# FHIR Invoice resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + date - Depricared by the element below.
# + note - Comments made about the invoice by the issuer, subject, or other participants.
# + totalGross - Invoice total, tax included.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + subject - The individual or set of individuals receiving the goods and services billed in this invoice.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'type - Type of Invoice depending on domain, realm an usage (e.g. internal/external, dental, preliminary).
# + issuer - The organizationissuing the Invoice.
# + participant - Indicates who or what performed or participated in the charged service.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + cancelledReason - In case of Invoice cancellation a reason must be given (entered in error, superseded by corrected invoice etc.).
# + creation - Date/time(s) of when this Invoice was posted.
# + paymentTerms - Payment details such as banking details, period of payment, deductibles, methods of payment.
# + identifier - Identifier of this Invoice, often used for reference in correspondence about this invoice or for tracking of payments.
# + totalPriceComponent - The total amount for the Invoice may be calculated as the sum of the line items with surcharges/deductions that apply in certain conditions. The priceComponent element can be used to offer transparency to the recipient of the Invoice of how the total price was calculated.
# + periodDate - Date/time(s) range of services included in this invoice.
# + totalNet - Invoice total , taxes excluded.
# + periodPeriod - Date/time(s) range of services included in this invoice.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.
# + lineItem - Each line item represents one charge for goods and services rendered. Details such.ofType(date), code and amount are found in the referenced ChargeItem resource.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + recipient - The individual or Organization responsible for balancing of this invoice.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + account - Account which is supposed to be balanced with this Invoice.
# + status - The current state of the Invoice.
