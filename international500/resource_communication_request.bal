# FHIR CommunicationRequest resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Comments made about the request by the requester, sender, recipient, subject or other participants.
# + reason - Describes why the request is being made in coded or textual form.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + subject - The patient or group that is the focus of this communication request.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + about - Other resources that pertain to this communication request and to which this communication request should be associated.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + medium - A channel that was used for this communication (e.g. email, fax).
# + statusReason - Captures the reason for the current state of the CommunicationRequest.
# + payload - Text, attachment(s), or resource(s) to be communicated to the recipient.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + doNotPerform - If true indicates that the CommunicationRequest is asking for the specified action to *not* occur.
# + basedOn - A plan or proposal that is fulfilled in whole or in part by this request.
# + requester - The device, individual, or organization who asks for the information to be shared.
# + identifier - Business identifiers assigned to this communication request by the performer or other systems which remain constant as the resource is updated and propagates from server to server.
# + authoredOn - For draft requests, indicates the date of initial creation. For requests with other statuses, indicates the date of activation.
# + replaces - Completed or terminated request(s) whose function is taken by this new request.
# + encounter - The Encounter during which this CommunicationRequest was created or to which the creation of this record is tightly associated.
# + priority - Characterizes how quickly the proposed act must be initiated. Includes concepts such as stat, urgent, routine.
# + intent - Indicates the level of authority/intentionality associated with the CommunicationRequest and where the request fits into the workflow chain.
# + informationProvider - The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, or device) which is to be the source of the communication.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.
# + occurrencePeriod - The time when this communication is to occur.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + recipient - The entity (e.g. person, organization, clinical information system, device, group, or care team) which is the intended target of the communication.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + occurrenceDateTime - The time when this communication is to occur.
# + category - The type of message to be sent such as alert, notification, reminder, instruction, etc.
# + groupIdentifier - A shared identifier common to multiple independent Request instances that were activated/authorized more or less simultaneously by a single author. The presence of the same identifier on each request ties those requests together and may have business ramifications in terms of reporting of results, billing, etc. E.g. a requisition number shared by a set of lab tests ordered together, or a prescription number shared by all meds ordered at one time.
# + status - The status of the proposal or order.
