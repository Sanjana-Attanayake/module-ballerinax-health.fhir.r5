# FHIR MeasureReport resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + date - The date this measure was calculated.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + subject - Optional subject identifying the individual or individuals the report is for.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + improvementNotation - Whether improvement in the measure is noted by an increase or decrease in the measure score.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + 'type - The type of measure report. This may be an individual report, which provides the score for the measure for an individual member of the population; a subject-listing, which returns the list of members that meet the various criteria in the measure; a summary report, which returns a population count for each of the criteria in the measure; or a data-collection, which enables the MeasureReport to be used to exchange the data-of-interest for a quality measure.
# + inputParameters - A reference to a Parameters resource (typically represented using a contained resource) that represents any input parameters that were provided to the operation that generated the report.
# + evaluatedResource - Evaluated resources are used to capture what data was involved in the calculation of a measure. This usage is only allowed for individual reports to ensure that the size of the MeasureReport resource is bounded.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + group - The results of the calculation, one for each population group in the measure.
# + identifier - A formal identifier that is used to identify this MeasureReport when it is represented in other formats or referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance.
# + period - The reporting period for which the report was calculated.
# + scoring - Indicates how the calculation is performed for the measure, including proportion, ratio, continuous-variable, and cohort. The value set is extensible, allowing additional measure scoring types to be represented. It is expected to be the same as the scoring element on the referenced Measure.
# + supplementalData - A reference to a Resource that represents additional information collected for the report. If the value of the supplemental data is not a Resource (i.e. evaluating the supplementalData expression for this case in the measure results in a value that is not a FHIR Resource), it is reported as a reference to a contained Observation resource.
# + reporter - The individual or organization that is reporting the data.
# + dataUpdateType - Indicates whether the data submitted in a data-exchange report represents a snapshot or incremental update. A snapshot update replaces all previously submitted data for the receiver, whereas an incremental update represents only updated and/or changed data and should be applied as a differential update to the existing submitted data for the receiver.
# + reportingVendor - A reference to the vendor who queried the data, calculated results and/or generated the report. The ‘reporting vendor’ is intended to represent the submitting entity when it is not the same as the reporting entity. This extension is used when the Receiver is interested in getting vendor information in the report.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.
# + measure - A reference to the Measure that was calculated to produce this report.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + location - A reference to the location for which the data is being reported.
# + status - The MeasureReport status. No data will be available until the MeasureReport status is complete.
