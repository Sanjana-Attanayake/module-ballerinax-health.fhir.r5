# FHIR EBMRecommendation resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + date - The date (and optionally time) when the artifact assessment was published. The date must change when the disposition changes and it must change if the workflow status code changes. In addition, it should change when the substantive content of the artifact assessment changes.
# + citeAsReference - Display of or reference to the bibliographic citation of the recommendation.
# + identifier - A formal identifier that is used to identify this artifact assessment when it is represented in other formats, or referenced in a specification, model, design or an instance.
# + copyright - A copyright statement relating to the artifact assessment and/or its contents. Copyright statements are generally legal restrictions on the use and publishing of the artifact assessment.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + approvalDate - The date on which the resource content was approved by the publisher. Approval happens once when the content is officially approved for usage.
# + artifactReference - A reference to a resource, canonical resource, or non-FHIR resource which is the recommendation this comment or assessment is about.
# + artifactCanonical - A reference to a resource, canonical resource, or non-FHIR resource which is the recommendation this comment or assessment is about.
# + workflowStatus - Indicates the workflow status of the comment or change request.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + citeAsMarkdown - Display of or reference to the bibliographic citation of the recommendation.
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + title - A short title for the assessment for use in displaying and selecting.
# + content - A component comment, classifier, or rating of the artifact.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, nor can they have their own independent transaction scope. This is allowed to be a Parameters resource if and only if it is referenced by a resource that provides context/meaning.
# + disposition - Indicates the disposition of the responsible party to the comment or change request.
# + lastReviewDate - The date on which the resource content was last reviewed. Review happens periodically after approval but does not change the original approval date.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + artifactUri - A reference to a resource, canonical resource, or non-FHIR resource which is the recommendation this comment or assessment is about.
